This project predicts the AC power generated by two solar power plants in India using weather sensor data. The data (which consisted of power generation data and weather sensor data) was preprocessed and visualized to explore key patterns. Various machine learning models were tested, including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Support Vector Regression, and XGBRegressor. The final model, XGBRegressor, was deployed using Flask for real-time solar power generation predictions.

The prediction model has been deployed on Render - https://solar-power-generation-forecasting.onrender.com
